# MISP can be updated from the webinterface.
# Unfortunately some governmental agencies suggest proxy-servers in front of every tea can.
# I had problems to update MISP from the webinterface (https://github.com/MISP/MISP/issues/1935)
# But it is very easy to update MISP from the commandline

# To update to the latest commit from commandline from the 2.4 branch simply pull the latest commit
# You have to be root
cd /var/www/MISP
git pull origin 2.4
git submodule update --init --recursive
